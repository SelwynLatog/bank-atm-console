Bank Console App

A simple bank console application written in C#.
I made this as a warm-up project after coming back to coding, and as practice for our OOP elective.

I recently worked through a large C++ project, so this project is intentionally smaller and more focused on clean structure rather than scale. The goal was to apply what I’ve learned so far in C# and keep the code organized and readable.

Features:
-User creation
-Input validation templates
-Cursor-based menus
-Basic transaction handling

I’ll continue refining and adding features as I learn more about C# and object-oriented design.
